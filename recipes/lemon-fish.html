        <p><em>Pan Seared Fish</em>: This fish is so good, it could make 
            a grown man weep. It's crispy on the outside, tender on the 
            inside, and so flavorful you'd consider living in the ocean. 
            But seriously, this pan-seared fish is so delicious, it might 
            just be the catch of the day, every day.</p>

        <h2>Steps:</h2> 
        <h3><em>It's time to get your 'roe' on!</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the fish fillets and pat them dry with a paper towel. 
                Season both sides of the fish with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter and olive oil in a non-stick skillet 
                over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the butter is melted and the oil is hot, add the 
                fish fillets to the skillet. Sear the fish on one side for 
                about 3-4 minutes, until the skin is golden brown and 
                crispy.</li>
            <li>Flip the fish over and add the minced garlic to the skillet. 
                Sear the fish on the other side for an additional 
                3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the fish from the skillet and place it on a plate.</li>
            <li>To the same skillet, add the freshly squeezed lemon juice 
                and chopped fresh herbs. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the 
                herbs are fragrant and the sauce has slightly thickened.</li>
            <li>Pour the herb and lemon sauce over the fish fillets.</li>
            <li>Serve the pan-seared lemon herb fish with your choice of 
                sides, such as steamed vegetables or rice.</li>
        </ol>
